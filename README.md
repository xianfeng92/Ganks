### some Details

1. Presenters in this layer are composed with interactors that perform the job in a new thread outside the main android UI thread, and come back using a callback with the data that will be rendered in the view.

2. Domain Library a pure java module without any android dependencies. All the external components use interfaces when connecting to the data Library.

3. All data needed for the application comes from data Library , through a MeiziRepository implementation (the interface is in the domain)
